# Hi, I'm Julia :waving_hand:

I'm a RTL designer and serial tinkerer.

{{< figure

    caption="Me and my little robot. I build this hexapod robot from scratch when I was 18, it was my first major project and opened my eyes to the joy of figuring it out."
>}}

Although I was born in France, I have lived in 6 different countries, and am
currently living in the US.

Professionally, I have a Masters in Electrical and Computer Engineering, and have
previously worked as a CPU designer at ARM.

Lately I've gotten very interested in financial trading accelerators, and as such,
most of my free time is currently spent building a high frequency trading
accelerator from scratch. 

In this blog, I document my most recent projects, in the hopes to help others in
their own endeavors.

If you like what I do, don't hesitate to give me a star on github.
