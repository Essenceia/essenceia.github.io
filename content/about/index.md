# Hi, I'm Julia

I'm an digital designer and serial tinkerer.

{{< figure

    caption="Me and my little robot. I build this hexapod robot from scratch when I was 18, it was my first major project and opened my eyes to the joy of figuring it out."

Although I was born in France I have lived in 6 different countries and am
currently living in the US.

Professionally I have a masters in electrical and computer engineering and have
previously worked as a CPU designer at ARM.

Lately I gotten very interested in financial trading accelerators, and as such,
most of my free time is currently spent building a high frequency trading
accelerator from scratch. 

In this blog I document my most recent projects in the hopes to
help other in their own endeavours.

If you like what I do don't hesitate to give me a star on github 
and if you really like what I do I am currently looking for work.
