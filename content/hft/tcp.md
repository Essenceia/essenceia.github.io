# Introduction

This article is documentation for the single socket TCP RTL implementation.
This project was designed as part of the 
# Socket FSM



### Requirements 

My use case only calls for supporting a single `TCP` socket at a time.
Never the less, I will try to make this design as segmented as possible 
in order to add support for multiply socket in the future.
