## Introduction 

In this post, I will be going over the testing for the `MoldUDP64` and `ITCH`
modules. This article is best read after having read the post on designing the
`MoldUDP64` module and `ITCH` module.

Although both the `ITCH` and `MoldUDP64` modules have their own small SystemVerilog
test benches, these test benches are relatively simple and do not offer
extensive testing coverage. Additionally, they are limited to a single block,
and experience has taught me that a lot can go wrong when connecting different
modules. The goal of this top-level test bench is to provide more comprehensive
testing for each block and test the system as a whole.

The goal when designing this top-level test bench was to simulate the driving
signals our hardware would encounter if it were connected directly to the
`NASDAQ` data feed. To closely match real-world behavior within the constraints
of my nonexistent budget, our test bench will recreate data feed packets based
on `NASDAQ`-provided logs containing `ITCH` messages captured at the exchange.

`NASDAQ` generously provides these files free of charge, and they can be found
[here](https://emi.nasdaq.com/ITCH/Nasdaq%20ITCH/).

{{< github repo="Essenceia/Nasdaq-HFT-FPGA" >}}

## Architecture 

The `NASDAQ` data feed directly updates participants on changes in the status via
`ITCH` messages. These messages are delivered by `MoldUDP64` packets. A single
`MoldUDP64` packet can contain multiple `ITCH` messages."

The objective of our testbench will be to read this dump file and extract the
`ITCH` messages. We will then recreate a `MoldUDP64` packet containing multiple
of these messages and break it down into smaller payloads of the corresponding
size to the `UDP -> MoldUDP64` data width and feed them through the simulator.

In parallel, the testbench will decode the `ITCH` message and produce the next
expected `ITCH` module decoder output. This expected outcome will be compared
to the actual `ITCH` module output, completing the self-testing loop.

### `NASDAQ` `ITCH` file 

During the testbench initialization, the user will
provide the path to the `NASDAQ` `ITCH` dump file. 

This `NASDAQ`-provided dump file contains multiple `ITCH` messages stored using
the `NASDAQ`-specified `BinaryFILE` format.

{{< figure
    src="top_tb/bin_file.svg"
    alt=""
    caption="`BinaryFILE` format."

Each payload contains a single `ITCH` message in its raw binary format. 

Since reading these files and decoding the `ITCH` messages are operations I
perform in other contexts, the code for these operations is in my
`TotalView-ITCH 5.0` library.

{{< github repo="Essenceia/TotalView_ITCH_5.0_C_lib" >}} 

### Fake `MoldUDP64` packet

Each of our `MoldUDP64` packets contains a random number of `ITCH` messages
extracted from the dump file. For each `ITCH` message that is added to the
packet, we push the expected decoded `ITCH` module output to a FIFO to be
dequeued later during checking.

{{< figure
    src="top_tb/mold_pkg.svg"
    alt=""
    caption="`MoldUDP64` package format, containing multiple `ITCH` messages."
>}}

Once this new `MoldUDP64` packet has been created, we then 'flatten' the
intermediate `C` structure representation into its binary format. During
simulation, if the `MoldUDP64` signals it is ready to accept a new payload, the
testbench will write at most the next 64 bits (or data bus width between the
`UDP -> MoldUPD64`) onto the bus.

### Decoded output checking 

Within a few cycles of simulation, the `ITCH` module will have received a full
message and will drive it on its outbound interface. 

At this moment, we will
dequeue the expected `ITCH` decoded signals we stored earlier when creating the
`MoldUDP64` packet onto a series of testbench-driven signals that mirror the real
`ITCH` outbound interface.  

We will then compare the testbench-driven expected
outbound signal values with the values obtained from the logic. This checking
is performed in the SystemVerilog part of the testbench using a series of
assertions.  

```systemverilog
`assert_stop( tb_itch_system_event_v == itch_system_event_v_o);
`assert_stop( ~tb_itch_system_event_v | tb_itch_system_event_v & tb_itch_system_event_stock_locate == itch_system_event_stock_locate_o);
`assert_stop( ~tb_itch_system_event_v | tb_itch_system_event_v & tb_itch_system_event_tracking_number == itch_system_event_tracking_number_o);
`assert_stop( ~tb_itch_system_event_v | tb_itch_system_event_v & tb_itch_system_event_timestamp == itch_system_event_timestamp_o);
`assert_stop( ~tb_itch_system_event_v | tb_itch_system_event_v & tb_itch_system_event_event_code == itch_system_event_event_code_o);
```

If both the message type and the decoded message fields content
match, the check is successful; otherwise, the assertion will trigger.

### Liveness 

In our testbench, we are practically always sending valid payloads to the
`MoldUDP64` module, but during testing, a few bugs caused long periods without a
valid `ITCH` decoded message. 

To quickly detect these cases and simplify tracking
down these bugs, a liveness counter was added. 

It is reset whenever a valid
`ITCH` message is decoded and will trigger an assertion once it reaches `0`.

## Test bench

Our top-level testbench is coded using a mix of `C` and `SystemVerilog` and runs
using the Icarus Verilog (`iverilog`) simulator. The `C` code interfaces with the
simulator using the Verilog Procedural Interface (`VPI`).  

Using this approach is
particularly convenient, as it allows me to build much more complex testbenches
than I could with `SystemVerilog` alone and also enables easy reuse of my code
base.  

For illustration, this testbench uses my `C` `TotalView-ITCH 5.0` library
for parsing the `NASDAQ` log file.


### Verilog Procedural Interface (VPI)  

In practice, the `C` code is compiled and linked into a shared object, which is
loaded at runtime by the simulator.

As this is a shared object, we must compile our `.o` to be position
independent. This is done using the `-fpic` compile flag: 
```makefile 
FLAGS = -fpic 

moldudp64.o: moldudp64.c moldudp64.h
    $(CC) -c moldudp64.c $(FLAGS)
```

To link to the target `vpi` format I am using the `-shared` and `-lvpi` flags :
```makefile 
tb.vpi: tb.o tb_utils.o tb_itch.o tv.o moldudp64.o axis.o tb_rand.h tb_config.h libitch.a 	
    $(LD) -shared -o tb.vpi tb.o tv.o axis.o moldudp64.o tb_utils.o tb_itch.o $(LIB) -lvpi 
```

When launching the `iverilog` simulation I specify the `vpi`â€™s name and
directory using the `-m<vpi_file>` and `-M <vpi_dir>` arguments : 

```makefile
run: test vpi 	
    vvp -M $(VPI_DIR) -mtb $(BUILD)/hft_tb 
```


Please note, the VPI interface is simulator-specific, so the earlier snippets
are only applicable with `iverilog`.

As of writing, I have not added support for `verilator` to this
testbench. If readers want to see an example of a VPI-enabled testbench with
dual `iverilog` and `verilator` support, I would point you towards my 
[Ethernet Physical Layer testbench](https://github.com/Essenceia/ethernet-physical-layer/blob/28a1a6a9fc1a0033b5cac89fde349a17266c27c7/Makefile).

{{< /alert >}}


Upon loading, using VPI, we register four new custom system functions with the
simulator. 

Each time these are reached in simulation, the corresponding C code is called.
These are `$tb_init`, `$tb`, `$tb_itch`, and `$tb_end`. They can be called like
any other system function. For reference, `$random` is a system function.

#### `$tb_init`

`$tb_init` is used to initialize the C part of the testbench and allows the
user to provide the path to the `NASDAQ` `ITCH` dump file to be used in this
simulation. 

If the file cannot be found, the simulation aborts.

Usage : 
```systemverilog 
$tb_init("<nasdaq_file_path>"); 
```

#### `$tb`

`$tb` simulates a 64 bit `axis` bus between a hypothetical `UDP` block to the
`MoldUDP64` module. 

Usage : 
```systemverilog
logic        axis_ready;
logic        axis_valid;
logic [63:0] axis_data;
logic [7:0]  axis_keep;
logic        axis_last;

logic        tb_finished;

$tb(axis_ready, axis_valid, axis_data, axis_keep,axis_last, tb_finished); 
``` 
It reads the `axis_ready` driven by the
`MoldUPD64` and correspondingly writes the content of `axis_valid`,
`axis_data`, `axis_keep` and `axis_last`.  It also writes out a `tb_finished`
signal to indicate the `C` testbench has reached the end of the `ITCH` file and we
can safely stop the simulation.

#### `$tb_itch`

`$tb_itch` drives the expected values on the duplicate `ITCH` outbound
interface. Whenever a new `ITCH` message is decoded these values are compared
with the actual output of the `ITCH` module to check for any differences.

Usage : 
```systemverilog 
$tb_itch(<duplicate_itch_outbound_interface>); 
```

## Conclusion

This top-level testbench allowed me to verify the behavior of the `MoldUDP64` and
`ITCH` modules in much more depth than the smaller block-level testbenches ever
could.

Its next upcoming evolution will likely be to add support for verilator for
faster iteration time and eventually integrate the `MAC`, `IPv4`, and `UDP` modules.
