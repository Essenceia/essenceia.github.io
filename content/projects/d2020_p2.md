## Introduction

This article serves as a quick follow-up to the previous post on
[Troubleshooting the Redstone
D2020](https://essenceia.github.io/projects/d2020_p1/). Its goal is to provide
a straightforward solution for adjusting the fan speed of the switch.

## Dealing with a Noisy Switch

If your dream is to live in a server room, then the Celestica Redstone D2020,
available for around $300 on eBay, might be the right choice for you. However,
for the rest of us who prefer a quieter environment, finding a way to reduce
the fan noise is crucial for making the most out of this purchase.

### Solution

The purpose of this script is to make the switch quieter by adjusting the fan
speed. This fan speed can be modified by resetting its `pwm` in the associated
Linux configuration file. 


By default, I connect to the switch via `telnet` and
log in to a custom `cli` rather than a Linux shell.

{{< figure

As a result, the first step is to escalate from the `cli` to the Linux shell.

To automate the interaction with the `telnet` text interface, I use a `tcl`
package called `expect`. The `tcl` portion of the script is named
`silence.expect` and is invoked by the bash entry point called `silence.sh`.

{{< github repo="essenceia/switch_scripts" >}}

#### `silence.sh`

This Bash script begins by sourcing configurations from the `config.sh` file,
which includes the switch's hostname, username/password, and the target pwm.
The `config.sh` file is not included in the repository by default, but users
can find an example file called `config_example.sh` and rename it to
`config.sh` once modified.

Next, it invokes the `tcl` script with these configurations.

```bash 
#!/bin/bash

# configuation file
CONFIG=config.sh

# Source username and password
if [ ! -f $CONFIG ]; then
    echo "File $CONFIG not found."
	exit 1
fi
source $CONFIG
printf "sourcing configuration file, set variables :\nhostname:$HOST\nuser:$USER\npassword:$PW\ntarget pwm:$PWM\n"

# Call expect on switch and shut it up
expect switch.expect $HOST $PWM $USER $PW 
```

#### `silence.expect`

This `tcl` script manages the connection to the switch via `telnet`, handles
privilege escalation from the `cli` to the Linux bash, and ultimately writes
the new fan pwm values.

```tcl
#!/usr/bin/expect
set timeout 20
set hostName [lindex $argv 0]
set pwm [lindex $argv 1]
set userName [lindex $argv 2]
set password [lindex $argv 3]

spawn telnet $hostName
expect "Trying $hostName..."
expect "Connected to $hostName."
expect "Escape character is '^]'."
expect ""
expect "User:"
send "$userName\r"
expect "Password:"
send "$password\r";
send "enable\r"
send "linuxsh\r"
expect "#"
send "echo $pwm > /sys/class/thermal/manual_pwm\r"
send "exit\r"
expect "Connection closed by foreign host."
send "quit\r"
send "quit\r"
interact
```
